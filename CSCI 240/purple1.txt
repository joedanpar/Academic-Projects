A frequently cited example of purple prose is the penultimate paragraph of 
The Garden of Cyrus by Sir Thomas Browne (1605-82), first published in 1658:

    But the Quincunx of Heaven runs low, and 'tis time to close the five ports
 of knowledge. We are unwilling to spin out our awaking thoughts into the 
phantasms of sleep, which often continueth precogitations; making Cables of 
Cobwebs and Wildernesses of handsome Groves. Besides Hippocrates hath spoke 
so little and the Oneirocriticall Masters, have left such frigid Interpretations
 from plants that there is little encouragement to dream of Paradise it self. 
Nor will the sweetest delight of Gardens afford much comfort in sleep; wherein
 the dullness of that sense shakes hands with delectable odours; and though 
in the Bed of Cleopatra, can hardly with any delight raise up the Ghost of a Rose.

A more recent author famous for purple prose is Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 
1st Baron Lytton (1803-73), who begins his novel Paul Clifford (1830) with
 the sentence:

    It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrent--except at 
occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which 
swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling 
along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps 
that struggled against the darkness.

Often shortened to just "It was a dark and stormy night", this opening has 
given rise to the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, in which 
contestants are asked to supply equally florid opening sentences to their 
own otherwise imaginary novels.
