From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A term of literary criticism, purple prose is used to describe passages, or
sometimes entire literary works, written in prose so overly extravagant, 
ornate or flowery as to break the flow and draw attention to itself. 
Purple prose is sensuously evocative beyond the requirements of its context. 
It also refers to writing that employs certain rhetorical effects such as 
exaggerated sentiment or pathos in an attempt to manipulate a reader's response.
When it is limited to certain passages, they may be termed purple patches 
or purple passages; these are often noted as standing out from the rest of the work.
