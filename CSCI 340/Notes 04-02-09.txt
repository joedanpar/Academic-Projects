A B-tree of order m^1 is a multiway search tree with the
following properties:
	1. The root has at least two subtrees unless it is a leaf.
	2. Each non-root and non-leaf node holds k-1 keys and k
	   pointers to subtrees where [m/2] <= k <= m //rounded up
	3. Each leaf node holds k-1 keys where [m/2] <= k <= m //rounded up
	4. all leaves are on the same level
^1 - Order specifies the maximum number of children a node may have

B-tree of order 10:
	template<class KeyType>
	class BTreeNode
		{
		KeyType keys[9];
		BTreeNode<KeyType>* links[10];
			.
			.
			.
		};
